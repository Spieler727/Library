# Library-Management-System
This project is supposed to be an implementation of a library management system for books and games where the user can store them by using the title and genre of said object, type (for books), and give a completion status and rating. The user can also display details of said object or even filter the books/games libraries by genre, completion status, and ratings in both ascending and descending order. 

Plans: convert this into an interactable application/interface. 

Changes: Added a function to remove a book or game by its title/name 

Notes to self: 
Can refer back to project for usage of lambda and remove_if functions
