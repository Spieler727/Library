# Library-Management-System
This project is supposed to be an implementation of a library management system for books and games where the user can store them by using the title and genre of said object,
type (for books), and give a completion status and rating. The user can also display details of said object or even filter the books/games libraries by genre, completion status, 
and ratings in both ascending and descending order.


Plans: convert into an interactable application/interface.
